# Welcome

**Mautic** is an open source marketing automation platform empowering organizations to build meaningful connections with their audiences through data-driven engagement.

This organization is home to projects, documentation, and initiatives that help maintain, extend, and improve Mautic for everyone.

Our shared goal is to make marketing automation **open, accessible, and community-driven** — where anyone can contribute ideas, code, or creativity to help Mautic grow.

## Our mission and identity

We believe in a world where marketing technology is:

- **Open:** Free to use, study, and improve, without unnecessary vendor constraints.  
- **Collaborative:** Built by a diverse global community of marketers, developers, and users.  
- **Privacy-focused and digitally sovereign:** You keep control (your own database, your infrastructure).

## Brief history and governance

Mautic was founded in **2014** by **David Hurley**.  
Over time, it evolved into a **community-led open source project**.

- Mautic’s finances and sponsorships are handled transparently via **[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/mautic)**.  
- **[The Mautic Council](https://contribute.mautic.org/en/latest/governance/mautic-council.html)** and teams help with governance, strategy, and operations.  
- Learn more about governance on the Mautic [Governance](https://mautic.org/governance) page.

## What we do

Mautic brings together developers, marketers, documentation writers, designers, and contributors to:

- **Maintain the Mautic Core:** The main [Mautic](https://github.com/mautic/mautic) open source application. 
- **Develop Plugins and Integrations:** Extend to CRMs, CMSs, email services, and more.
- **Support Learning and Documentation:** Help new users, maintain guides, improve clarity.  
- **Foster Community and Events:** Run forums, conferences (e.g., the Mautic World Conference), and meetups.  
- **Promote Open Marketing Standards and Privacy:** Champion principles of digital sovereignty and user privacy.
